You must prepare your vector file before you start to set up the laser cutter.
Make sure your project isn't larger than the material you plan to use.  
Run smaller test cuts.
Make a note of your settings when working on a project.

**Materials:**
You can cut poplar plywood, acrylic, paper, cardboard, and fabric.
You cannot cut mirror, rock, glass, metallic materials, or MDF.

**How it Works:**
In the back of the machine is a big CO2 tube that generates a laser at the far end of the infa-red spectrum.  Three mirrors reflect the laser to the gantry head.  The lens then focuses the beam into an hour glass shape which is what then cuts the material. 

A safety cutoff prevents the laser from firing while the lid or sides are open.

The laser runs from left to right, cuts running lengthwise will cut faster than cuts going up and down.  When laying out rasters have them run along the length of the bed. 

**How to Setup the Laser:**

1.  Turn on the laser
2.  Place material on the bed, make sure it lies flat
3.  Focus the laser on the Z axis
     a.  Put into focus mode
     b.  Place the focus tool on top of your material, 
     c.  Line the 45 slope with the front of the laser carriage.  Use the up and down arrows (reversed) to move the cutting bed up and down.
     d. Move in .01mm increments to get the focus tool precise and snug underneath the bottom of the carriage.  Make sure the flat part of the focus tool is flush against the side of the carriage.
     e. Put focus tool away
  
4. Close the laser cutter lid 
Do not slam the lid.  If it is closed but the machine disagrees, gently jiggle the lid from side-to-side.

5. Place your project file on the computer desktop and open Illustrator
6. Select Print > Setup > Preferences > Manual
    a. Select the profile you want to change (ie: red, blue, black) Load > Laser Settings > System C/Laser Settings
    b. Apply > OK
    

  Power vs Speed - running a hand through the candle flame.  
  PPI (surface treatment) - how many pulses - acrylic high PPI, cotton low PPI  - doesnâ€™t help cut deeper.

    
7. Time your files
8. Pull the red lever behind the laser cutter, this turns on the compressor (clears smoke & debris) and turn on the bed extraction.  You can also turn on top extraction if cutting out objects with small details or light materials.  Bed extraction pulls from underneath, top extraction pulls from above the bed.  
9. Press the green play button to start cutting

**Note:**

* Pressing pause will send the laser head back to home.  This is a good way to stop fires.
* E-stop cuts the power (good if material is caught)
* Resume your cut using small red play button.

* Do not stare at the laser

* There is a fire extinguisher in the event of a fire

10. When the job finishes do not move the material until you check to make sure it cut the whole way through.
