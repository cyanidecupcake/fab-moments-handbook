# Guidelines


In order to make this project accessible to a wide variety of age-ranges we have set only basic guidelines.  Much of the creative process is up to each individual team and the capabilities of their host site.

## The Brief 
In a small team design and build a HOME. The shape and style of the HOME is up to your team as long as it does not exceed the maximum dimensions and you can use your choice of material.

**Maximum Size**

H: 331mm  W: 264mm  D: 345mm (Metric) <br>
H: 13 inches  W: 10.4 inches  D: 13.5 inches (Imperial)

**Materials**

Any laser cut material, 3D printing, recycled material, fabric, etc, as long as it’s durable enough to withstand 10+ days of outdoor exposure.

* Must light up or be illuminated (if adding electronics is too complex or not necessary, then you can choose to have lighting from above or underneath). LUX is a light festival, so light is important.

* Submissions including electronics must use an Arduino to control lights/sound/etc, and the code must be posted to GitHub. Host sites don’t have to send their Arduinos, the Fab Lab Wgtn team will programme their Arduinos from the code you supply on GitHub.


Each Fab Lab or team can provide as many HOMEs as they wish, but Fab Lab Wgtn needs to know by January 17th how many contributions so that they can create the correct structure to hold them all.

**Teams**

Each host site must have at least one team of between 3-5 students.  Each team will create one HOME.  Teams should have a team name. This team name will represent their group throughout the duration of the project.

**Communication**

Each participating team will have a page on our central blog, [FabMoments.org](http://www.fabmoments.org), to post weekly updates and progress. 

FABpals will also aim to communicate via video chat at least three times over the course of the project. These contacts may be made via the MCU, Skype, or Google Hangouts. If timezones are an issue, short videos will also suffice.
