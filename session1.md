### Group Discussion:

As the old saying goes, there's no place like home!  But what is home?  The idea of home holds many different meanings for different people.  At its most sterile, a home is a building in which people live.  Home can be a small apartment, a house with a large yard, or a bach on the beach.   Whether big or small the places we call home can also be a source of great emotion.  These are our tūrangawaewae, ‘a place to stand’.  The spaces in which we find belonging and safety.

* What does type of homes are there?  What do they look like?
* What does *home* mean to you?
* What feelings can home evoke? 
* What is the most important room in your house?  Why?
* How does the local environment impact housing?

### Introduction to Fab Moments | HOME


Over the next few sessions we will work together to brainstorm, plan, prototype, and build an art piece to reflect our ideas of home.  This art piece will be shipped to Wellington, New Zealand for display in a light festival called LUX.

There are some rules we have to follow when making our HOME:

1. Our HOME cannot be larger than H: 331mm W: 264mm D: 345mm
2. Our HOME must light up
3. Our HOME can be made out of any type of material, but it must be durable
4. Our HOME must be able to withstand 10 days outside, possibly in rain and wind

Throughout this project we will occasionally have video chats with other kids creating HOMEs around the world.  These will be our digital pen pals or FABpals.  Once the LUX light festival is over, we will receive the HOME our FABpals made and they will receive ours.

We will also document and blog our creative process to share with others.

### Activity

Today we will each brainstorm to come up with ideas for our HOME.

Each participant should draw 
Participants can draw/write their ideas for what the write as many ideas as possible

* What materials might you use?
* How might light be used?
* What will your HOME look like?

### Group Share
Each participant lists three of their favourite ideas.  Each idea should be on a new sticky note.  All students then place their three sticky notes on a designated wall or similar space for everyone to read.

Nominate a student to read all the sticky notes aloud to the group.  Ideas that are similar should be grouped together.

If necessary, ask for further elaboration on ideas.  If time allows, encourage group discussion on popular ideas.  Record any particularly interesting ideas that may result.

During the Group Share make sure all ideas are read.  Emphasise that no idea is too silly to share.  All students should have their ideas heard. <br><br>
    
Remember to record the brainstorm ideas in a more permanent way, we will need them for next week.  You can either take a photo at the end of the session or take notes during the group share.<br><br>
    
Collect all brainstorm ideas (even ones not shared) at the end of the session.
    
Take a few photos of the planning session and update to the blog.  The following week official documenters for the project will be assigned.</div>
