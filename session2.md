This session we will be focusing on planning out our project.  This involves deciding what our HOME will look like, as well as setting deadlines and appointing tasks to each group member.


## Assigning Roles

*If they have not done so already, students should assemble into their groups. * 

Within your group you must decide and record:

* Your team name, this will be use throughout the project
* Team roles, write down which role each team member will have


**Project Manager** responsible for keeping the project on task. Must make sure all paper materials go into the folder and the HOME is put away at the end of each session.

**Official Documenters**
in charge of taking photos of the project in progress and posting a brief blog update at the end of each session

**Engineers** responsible for the building of the HOME.

**Programmers** responsible for programming the electrical components within the home.

Everyone is responsible for the completion of their group's HOME and everyone's input matters.  Just because you have a specific responsibility does not mean you do not have to help with other aspects of the project.

<u>Facilitators</u><br>
Allow 5-10 minutes for groups to discuss and record their team name and roles.

## Planning

Working together complete the planning worksheet.  Consider the sticky notes from last week's brainstorming session. 


* What materials will your HOME be made out of?

* Do you know how to create an object using these materials or will you have to learn? (ie: Laser cutter, 3D printer, etc)

* What electronics will you need for your HOME?
* What obstacles might you encounter that could make it difficult to complete your HOME?  How will you overcome them?

* What will your HOME look like?  Work together to sketch out ideas.



Budget


Students should meet with a facilitator before the end of the session to pitch their idea.  Facilitators should ask questions to get the students thinking critically about the fesability of their project.

When your group is done planning take your worksheet to a facilitator for approval.  


### Milestones & Deadlines

Deadline: The date when something must be finished.

Milestone: An important point in a project

Your milestones might be:
1. Prototype complete
2. Build complete
3. Programming complete
4. Bug testing complete
5. Project complete
6. Project shipped -- (No later than 4 July)


Using a pencil write your milestones on your calendar along with any tasks you would like to complete in any session.  You can even assign specific tasks to group members so everyone knows that they are doing each session.

Place your calendar in your folder when finished.

**Objective: **Working together we will brainstorm, plan, prototype, and build an art piece to reflect our ideas of home. This art piece will be shipped to Wellington, New Zealand for display in the LUX light festival.

There are some rules we have to follow when making our HOME:

    Our HOME cannot be larger than H: 331mm W: 264mm D: 345mm
    Our HOME must light up
    Our HOME can be made out of any type of material, but it must be durable
    Our HOME must be able to withstand 10 days outside, possibly in rain and wind


Team Name:
Team Members:
Official Documenters


Sketch a design of your HOME.



Hard Deadline: 4 July (SHIPPED)








Provide a calendar for students to use
Provide a folder to remain at the host site or with the facilitator.



It also might be helpful to set a budget depending on what the host site can afford.  For younger kids create a simple "store" and fake money.  For teens, a budget can be utilised.





Things will go wrong, you will get off track, it is not the end of the world.  





SAMPLES:
