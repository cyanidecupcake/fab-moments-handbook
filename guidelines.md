# Guidelines

The Brief: In order to make this accessible for as many age teams as possible we have set some basic guidelines, but leave much of the creative process up to each individual team.

In a small team design and build a house. The shape and style of the house is up to your team as long as it does not exceed the maximum dimensions and you can use your choice of material.

**Maximum Size:**<br>
H: 331mm W: 264mm D: 345mm (Metric)
H: 13 inches W: 10.4 inches D: 13.5 inches (Imperial)

Must light up or be illuminated (if adding electronics is too complex or not necessary, then you can choose to have lighting from above or underneath). LUX is a light festival, so light is important.

Materials: any laser cut material, 3D printing, etc, as long as it’s durable enough to withstand 10+ days of outdoor exposure.

Submissions including electronics must use an Arduino to control lights/sound/etc, and the code must be put on GitHub. You don’t have to send the Arduinos, we will code ours from the code you supply on GitHub
Each Fab Lab or team can provide as many HOMEs as they wish, but Fab Lab Wgtn needs to know by January 17th how many contributions so that they can create the correct structure to hold them all.

Assemble into teams.  Each host site must have at least one team of between 3-5 students.  Each team will create one HOME.  Teams should have a team name will represent them throughout the duration of the project.

Communication:
Each participating team will have a page on our central blog, FabMoments.org, to post weekly updates and progress. Please create a great team name to represent your team.

FabPals will also aim to communicate via video chat at least three times over the course of the project. These contacts may be made via the MCU, Skype, or Google Hangouts. If timezones are an issue, short videos will also suffice.
