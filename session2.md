# Session 2 | Plan

Supplies

    Writing utensils (pencils, pens, markers, etc)
    Blank paper
    Books of architecture and homes from around the world*
    Examples of materials available to the students*
    Camera to document the session*
    
**Optional*

This session we will be focusing on planning out our project.  This involves deciding what our HOME will look like, as well as setting deadlines and appointing tasks to each group member.

If they have not done so already, students should assemble into their groups.  

Within your group you must decide and record:

* Your team name, this will be use throughout the project
* Team roles, write down which role each team member will have


**Project Manager** responsible for keeping the project on task. Must make sure all paper materials go into the folder and the HOME is put away at the end of each session.

**Official Documenters**
in charge of taking photos of the project in progress and posting a brief blog update at the end of each session

**Engineers** responsible for the building of the HOME.

**Programmers** responsible for programming the electrical components within the home.

Everyone is responsible for the completion of their group's HOME and everyone's input matters.  Just because you have a specific responsibility does not mean you do not have to help with other aspects of the project.

<u>Facilitators</u><br>
Allow 5-10 minutes for groups to discuss and record their team name and roles.

What materials will your HOME be made out of?

Do you know how to create an object using these materials or will you have to learn? (ie: Laser cutter, 3D printer, etc)

What electronics will you need for your HOME?

Working together sketch out ideas of what your HOME might look like.

What obstacles might make it difficult to complete this project?

**Objective: **Working together we will brainstorm, plan, prototype, and build an art piece to reflect our ideas of home. This art piece will be shipped to Wellington, New Zealand for display in the LUX light festival.

There are some rules we have to follow when making our HOME:

    Our HOME cannot be larger than H: 331mm W: 264mm D: 345mm
    Our HOME must light up
    Our HOME can be made out of any type of material, but it must be durable
    Our HOME must be able to withstand 10 days outside, possibly in rain and wind


Team Name:
Team Members:
Official Documenters


Sketch a design of your HOME.



Hard Deadline: 4 July (SHIPPED)


Deadline: The date when something must be finished.

-- Prototype

Milestone: An important point in a project

Your milestones might be:
1. Prototype complete
2. Build complete
3. Programming complete
4. Bug testing complete
5. Project complete
6. Project shipped -- no later than 4 July




Provide a calendar for students to use
Provide a folder to remain at the host site or with the facilitator.



It also might be helpful to set a budget depending on what the host site can afford.  For younger kids create a simple "store" and fake money.  For teens, a budget can be utilised.

Consider the sticky notes from last week

Students should meet with a facilitator before the end of the session to pitch their idea.  Facilitators should ask questions to get the students thinking critically about the fesability of their project.


Things will go wrong, you will get off track, it is not the end of the world.  


Do you know how to use these materials or will you have to learn? 
SAMPLES:
Simple arduino session, simple laser cutting & 3D printing session, simple git instructions, simple blog instructions, complete a handout for planning process
