# Tips for FABpal Check In


It can be difficult organising a video chat with multiple participants.  Use this guide to help facilitate a positive conversation between you and your FABpals!

---



Mentors should schedule check in two weeks in advance of the call. Use [TimeAndDate.com](http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/meeting.html) to account for time differences.


At least 3 video chats should take place throughout the course of the project. Recommended times for FABpal check ins are:


- Planning/Prototype Stage
- Building Stage
- Revising Stage


Plan what questions you want to ask before the chat begins

Remind your participants of the city and country of their FABpal's host site.

Test your internet conductivity

Listen to what your FABpal is saying, ask follow up questions if necessary

Take turns.

Starter Questions:

Can you explain your project? 

What are house's like in your city?  

What has been the most challenging part of your project so far?

What materials will you be using for your HOME?  Why?
