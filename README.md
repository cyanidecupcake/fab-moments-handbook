### What is FAB Moments?

FAB Moments uses the Fab Lab network to bring people around the globe together to collaborate on creative projects.

FAB Moments 2016 focuses on connecting youth in the Pacific Ring of Fire.  Youth will work together on a light-based art installation that will exhibit at Wellington LUX, an annual light festival in Wellington, NZ in August of 2016.

This year’s theme surrounds the idea of “Home”.   Participating youth will work in teams to develop an art piece that explores the idea of home. Upon completion, all pieces will be sent to Wellington and assembled into a larger, coherent piece.

### Who runs FAB Moments?
FAB Moments is a collaboration between Fab Lab Wellington, Makers Org NZ, and MakerBox.

Any organisation within the Pacific Ring of Fire that works with children and teens can register as a 2016 host site.  Participating students should be between the ages of 8 and 17 years of age.  Interested host sites should contact Wendy at Fab Lab Wellington.
