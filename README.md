This handbook is filled with resources and lesson plans for the [FAB Moments 2016](http://fabmoments.org/) campaign.  FAB Moments host sites can use this handbook to guide discussions and lessons with their students.

### What is FAB Moments?

FAB Moments uses the Fab Lab network to bring people around the globe together to collaborate on creative projects.

FAB Moments 2016 focuses on connecting youth in the Pacific Ring of Fire.  Youth will work together on a light-based art installation that will exhibit at Wellington LUX, a light festival in Wellington, NZ in winter of 2016.

This year’s theme surrounds the idea of “Home”.   Participating youth will work in teams to develop an art piece that explores the idea of home. Upon completion, all pieces will be sent to Wellington and assembled into a larger, coherent piece. Once the festival ends, each host site will receive their FabPal’s submission to the festival.
