# Session 2 | Plan

**Supplies**

* Writing utensils (pencils, pens, markers, etc)
* Blank paper
* Calendar print out (for each group)
* [Planning worksheet](https://github.com/cyanidecupcake/fab-moments-handbook/blob/master/Worksheets/planningWkst.pdf) (for each group)
* Folder (for each group)
* Books of architecture and homes from around the world*
* Examples of materials available to the students*
* Camera to document the session*
    
**Optional*

---

This session we will be focusing on planning out our project.  This involves deciding what our HOME will look like, as well as setting deadlines and appointing tasks to each group member.


## Assigning Roles

*If they have not done so already, students should assemble into their groups. * 

Within your group you must decide and record:

* Your team name, this will be use throughout the project
* Team roles, write down which role each team member will have


**Project Manager** 
responsible for keeping the project on task. Must make sure all paper materials go into the folder and the HOME is put away at the end of each session.

**Official Documenters**
in charge of taking photos of the project in progress and posting a brief blog update at the end of each session

**Engineers** 
responsible for the building of the HOME.

**Programmers** 
responsible for programming the electrical components within the home.

Everyone is responsible for the completion of their group's HOME and everyone's input matters.  Just because you have a specific responsibility does not mean you do not have to help with other aspects of the project.

## Planning

Working together complete the planning worksheet.  Consider the sticky notes from last week's brainstorming session. 


* What materials will your HOME be made out of? (ie. plywood, recycled materials, acrylic, fabric, etc)

* Do you know how to create an object using these materials or will you have to learn? (ie: Laser cutter, 3D printer, etc)

* What electronics will you need for your HOME?  (We will be using an Arduino to control any lights or sounds)

* What obstacles might you encounter that could make it difficult to complete your HOME?  How will you overcome them?

* What will your HOME look like?  Work together to sketch out ideas.  Consider that your home will be three-dimensional, but some people may view it through a window.



Students should meet with a facilitator before the end of the session to pitch their idea.  Facilitators should ask questions to get the students thinking critically about the feasibility of their project.

When your group is done planning take your worksheet to a facilitator for approval.  


## Milestones & Deadlines

**Deadline** The date when something must be finished.

**Milestone** An important point in a project

Your milestones might be:
1. Prototype complete
2. Build complete
3. Programming complete
4. Bug testing complete
5. Project complete
6. Project shipped -- (No later than 4 July)


Using a pencil, write your milestones on your calendar along with any tasks you would like to complete in the next session.  You can even assign specific tasks to group members so everyone knows what they are doing next session.

Place your calendar in your folder when finished.  



At the end of the session all folders should be returned to the facilitator.

### Additional Activity: Budget


It might be helpful to set monetary parameters to keep projects from becoming too expensive or complex. 

Facilitators can create simple "stores" within their host site with potential materials and an associated cost for a unit of each material.  At the start of the project present each group with a set amount of fake money and have them plan out a budget for the project.
