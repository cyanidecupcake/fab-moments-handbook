# Tips for FABpal Check In


It can be difficult organising a video chat with multiple participants.  Use this guide to help facilitate a positive conversation between you and your FABpals!

---



Mentors should schedule their check in two weeks in advance of the call. Use [TimeAndDate.com](http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/meeting.html) to account for time differences.


At least 3 video chats should take place throughout the course of the project. Recommended times for FABpal check ins are:


- Planning/Prototype Stage
- Building Stage
- Revising Stage


##Before the Chat
As a group plan what questions you want to ask and write them down in a Google Doc or Etherpad.

Decide who will be asking questions during the chat.  You can rotate Askers or have one dedicated Asker. 

Remind your group of the city and country of their FABpal's host site.  If you want, you can research a bit about your FABpal's home, but it might be fun to just ask them! 

Test your internet conductivity


##During the Chat
The Listeners and the Askers should each have access to a computer with the Google Doc or Etherpad page open. 

As the chat takes place Listeners can write questions in the Google Doc or Etherpad that they want the Asker to ask.

Listen to what your FABpal is saying when they answer your question.  Ask follow up questions if necessary.

Remember to take turns, you should ask a question, then your FABpal should have the opportunity to ask you a question.

When the chat is over, remember to thank your FABpals for talking with you.

## Starter Questions:


* Can you explain your project? 

* What are houses like where you live?  

* What has been the most challenging part of your project so far?

* What has been your favourite part of your project so far?

* What materials will you be using for your HOME?  Why?

* What electronics will you be using in your HOME?  Why?

##After the Chat

Groups should reflect on what they learned from their FABpals. Was anything surprising? Did any of their responses bring up more questions you want to ask next time?
